These scripts are used to find strategies and permutations for CSIDH-512 using
SIMBA. I have run them with Octave version 4.2.2, configured for
"x84_64-pc-linux-gnu"; I make no guarantees that they will work in other
versions of Octave or in any version of MATLAB without modification. And while
I am convinced that they typically run without error, I make no guarantee that
they are correct. 

To run the code as I have written it, at the octave command line, run Main().
The output is automatically saved to Parameters.mat.

    AlternatingAlgorithm.m: A naive alternating algorithm to optimize the
                            startegy and permutation for given multiplication 
                            and isogeny evaluation costs.

	 CostsAndIndices.m: Computes the matrix of costs of full strategies for
                            all contiguous and compatible subsets of given
                            vectors of multiplication and isogeny evaluation
                            costs.

		    Main.m: The main function used to find a strategy and
                            permutation. 

OptimalPermutationMatrix.m: Finds the optimal permutation for a given cost
                            model and strategy.

         OptimalStrategy.m: Returns the optimal full strategy for a given
                            (possibly permuted) cost model.

	      Partitions.m: Returns the partitions of n into k parts where each
                            part is between lb and ub. 

                   Setup.m: Loads CSIDH-512 parameters and cost model.

               SIMBAJoin.m: Joins a left SIMBA substrategy to a right
                            substrategy.

	StochasticSearch.m: Searches for a SIMBA partition, strategy, and
			    permutation which permforms well for the given
                            parameters.

	      StrategyDraw: Draws a strategy.

	      StrategyJoin: Joins a left substrategy to a right substrategy.
