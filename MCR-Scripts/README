The optimization "pipeline" that we use is as follows:

1. In the directory Full SIMBA Strategies, run octave-cli Main.m at the command
   line. This will use the parameter set and cost model defined in Setup.m to
   produce an initial SIMBA strategy and permutation, saved in Parameters.mat

2. After copying Parameters.mat into Bound Vector/ run Main.m in Matlab to
   obtain a bound vector, saved in BoundVector.mat. This script requires CVX to
   be installed.

3. After copying BoundVector.mat to Strategies/ run octave-cli Main.m at the
   command line to get a full parameter set, saved in Vs.txt (the vertical
   strategy matrices) and Perms.txt (the permutations).

4. Using Vs.txt and Perms.txt, update the V matrices and perm vectors in
   Sage-GenCode.sage. The lists m (of numbers of SIMBA substrategies), Vs, and
   perms must also be updated accordingly.

5. To obtain a working implementation, run sage Sage-GenCode.sage in the MCR
   directory. Then recompile by running make.
