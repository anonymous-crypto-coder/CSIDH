The script in this directory is used to produce a bound vector for an
implementation of CSIDH-512. I have run it in MATLAB_2018a using CVX version
4.2.2; I make no guarantees that it will work in other versions of MATLAB or in
any version of Octave without modification. And while I am convinced that it
typically runs without error, I make no guarantee that it is correct.


To run the code as I have written it, at the Matlab command line, run Main().
The output is automatically saved to BoundVector.mat.

The files in this directory are as follows:

Informational:
--------------
README: Describes the contents of this directory.

Matlab Script:
---------------

Main.m: Computes a bound vector for the parameters and cost model contained in
Parameters.mat. We use our heuristic mathematical program which we solve
approximately by iterative rounding. The result is written to BoundVector.mat.

Data File:
-----------

BoundVector.mat: Saves the output bound vector of Main.m.
