These scripts are used to find complete sets of strategies and permutations for
CSIDH-512 using SIMBA. I have run them with Octave version 4.2.2, configured
for "x84_64-pc-linux-gnu"; I make no guarantees that they will work in other
versions of Octave or in any version of MATLAB without modification. And while
I am reasonably convinced that they typically run without error, I make no
guarantee that they are correct.

To run the code as I have written it, at the octave command line, run Main().
The output is automatically saved to FullParameterSet.mat.

The files in this directory are as follows:

Octave Scripts:
---------------
    AlternatingAlgorithm.m: A naive alternating algorithm to optimize the
                            startegy and permutation for given multiplication 
                            and isogeny evaluation costs.

	 CostsAndIndices.m: Computes the matrix of costs of full strategies for
                            all contiguous and compatible subsets of given
                            vectors of multiplication and isogeny evaluation
                            costs.

	 EverythingPrint.m: Using MatPrint.m and PermPrint.m, prints the set of
                            vertical strategy matrices and corresponding
                            permutations to files in a format that is useful.

		    Main.m: The main function used to find the set of strategies
                            and permutations. 

		MatPrint.m: Prints a vertical strategy matrix to a file, in a
                            way that is useful to us.

      MultipleStrategies.m: Finds a complete set of strategies for a given set
                            of primes, cost model, and bound vector.

OptimalPermutationMatrix.m: Finds the optimal permutation for a given cost
                            model and strategy.

         OptimalStrategy.m: Returns the optimal full strategy for a given
                            (possibly permuted) cost model.

	      Partitions.m: Returns the partitions of n into k parts where each
                            part is between lb and ub. 

	       PermPrint.m: Prints a list of permutations in a way that is
                            convenient for postprocessing.

                   Setup.m: Loads CSIDH-512 parameters and cost model.

               SIMBAJoin.m: Joins a left SIMBA substrategy to a right
                            SIMBA substrategy.

	StochasticSearch.m: Searches for a SIMBA partition, strategy, and
			    permutation which permforms well for the given
                            parameters.

	      StrategyDraw: Draws a strategy.

	      StrategyJoin: Joins a left substrategy to a right substrategy.
